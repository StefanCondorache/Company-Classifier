# Task
Build a robust company classifier for a new insurance taxonomy.

# Objectives
Accept a list of companies with associated data:
– Company Description
– Business Tags
– Sector, Category, Niche Classification
Receive a static taxonomy (a list of labels) relevant to the insurance industry.
Build a solution that accurately classifies these companies, and any similar ones, into one or more labels from the static taxonomy.
Present your results and demonstrate effectiveness.

# Resources
 - List of Companies: company_list
 - Insurance Taxonomy: insurance_taxonomy

# The dictionary_based_solution is the main code solution producing the primary classification results saved in insurance_labels.csv.
# While the vector_based_solution serves as an alternative approach with its outputs stored in vector_insurance_labels.csv.
